Privacy Policy – Nexus Sales CRM Extension
Privacy Policy

Last updated: December 29, 2025

Overview

The Nexus Sales CRM browser extension (“the Extension”) is designed to allow users to transfer form data into their Nexus Sales CRM account. We take user privacy seriously and are committed to protecting any information processed by the Extension.

Information the Extension Collects

The Extension may collect the following information only when the user explicitly activates it:

Form field data visible on the current webpage (e.g., name, email, phone, address)

Workflow selection made by the user

Nexus Sales CRM API key entered by the user

The Extension does not automatically scrape data. Data is collected only when the user clicks the transfer button.

How Information Is Used

Collected data is used solely to:

Transfer user-selected form data into the user’s Nexus Sales CRM account

Associate the data with a selected workflow inside Nexus Sales CRM

The Extension does not:

Sell data

Share data with third parties

Use data for advertising or tracking

Store data beyond the immediate transfer operation

API Key Handling

The API key is provided directly by the user.

The API key is used only to authenticate requests to Nexus Sales CRM.

The API key is stored locally in the browser (if the user chooses “Save as default”) and is never transmitted to third-party services.

Data Storage

No scraped form data is permanently stored by the Extension.

Data exists only temporarily in memory for the purpose of transferring it to Nexus Sales CRM.

No analytics, tracking pixels, or third-party scripts are used.

Permissions Explanation

The Extension requests access to webpage content only to read form fields selected by the user. It does not monitor browsing activity, keystrokes, or pages unrelated to user actions.

Third-Party Services

The Extension communicates only with:

Nexus Sales CRM servers, as explicitly initiated by the user

No other third-party services are contacted.

Children’s Privacy

The Extension is not intended for use by children under the age of 13 and does not knowingly collect personal data from children.

Changes to This Policy

This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time. Updates will be reflected on this page with a revised “Last updated” date.
